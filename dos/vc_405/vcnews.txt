Changes in version 4.00.036 beta

- Global  VC.EXT was not being renewed in the RAM after editing.
  So  you  had  to  exit  VC and then start again VC to load new
  global VC.EXT.
- The  panels  were  not being rescaned after Rename/Move of one
  file with Ctrl-F6.
- If  option "Auto directory sizes" was  switched on  and choose
  sort  by size, directories were sorted but after any rescan of
  the panels the sorting disappeared.
- Any  control  symbols  is  possible to input using  Alt-NumPad
  without Ctrl-Q.

  correctly.

  were initiated by pressing of the first symbols in the command
  line and press Ctrl-Enter.

  disks is blocked.

  of  compatibility  mode. This  allows  to read just opened for
  writing files in multitask environment or in the network.

  tasks  when star sky screen saver is active. Previously it was
  only during enter expectation.

- Error prompts during  Copy/Rename/Move have Ok/Cancel menu. If
  the choice is Ok  so the following file will be treated (as it

  done for Delete and File attributes before).
- Pressing Ctrl-Break does not lead to ^C presence on the screen
  before command execution.
- If  directory  had  long file (number of located clusters more
  than  65535, the  situation  is  unreal but possible) so after
  pressing Ctrl-L the computer crashed during Info-panel output.

  cards.

  logical drive.

  allows  to identify the correct sequence during the pasting of
  the obtained parts.

- All new files after copy and files changed during editing will
  have attribute Archive.
