
SetMul v1.24 - Multiplier control for VIA C3, AMD K6+7+8 Mobile and Cyrix 5x86
G. Broers 2014..2019 - Free for non-profit use.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The main purpose of this program is to quickly change the multiplier of a select
range of x86 processors in MS-DOS and Windows 9X. In addition it can enable and 
disable processor L1 and L2 caches.
SetMul does not stay resident, but the toggled CPU registers will remain as set,
until the next system reset/reboot.


BACKGROUND
----------
Many DOS game and programs have issues with a CPU speed higher then expected,
while other software benefits from increased CPU speed. Having a means to
adjust the processor speed is important for making a system suitable for a
broad range of vintage software.
Originally a classic Pentium processor multiplier was set through jumpers,
without any means to adjust this through software. Around 2000 came a line of
'mobile' processors specifically aimed at laptops, which had a new feature to
preserve battery life when idle:
- Intel called this feature (Enhanced) SpeedStep.
- AMD   called this feature PowerNow!, later renamed to Cool'n'Quiet.
- VIA/Centaur called this feature Longhaul, later renamed to PowerSaver.
In all cases it is about temporarily decreasing the processor multiplier by
software. The resulting net processor speed is the Front Side Bus speed times
the selected multiplier. For example: 66 MHz FSB times 5.5 = 366 MHz.


MULTIPLIER OPTIONS
------------------
This table shows the available options for each supported processor:
VIA C3 Samuel 1:         3.0x to  8.0x, 11 choices
VIA C3 Samuel 2 step 0:  3.0x to  8.0x, 11 choices
VIA C3 Samuel 2 step 1+: 3.0x to 12.0x, 16 choices
VIA C3 Ezra:             3.0x to 12.0x, 16 choices
VIA C3 Ezra-T:           3.0x to 16.0x, 27 choices
VIA C3 Nehemiah:         4.0x to 16.0x, 25 choices
AMD K6-2+ / K6-III+:     2.0x to  6.0x,  8 choices  (2.5x is excluded)
AMD K7 Mobile (Athlon)   3.0x to 24.0x, 32 choices
AMD K8 (Athlon 64 etc.)  4.0x to 25.0x, 22 choices  (integer only)
Cyrix 5x86               1.0x to jumpered multiplier (2, 3 or 4), 2 choices
A VIA C3 may, or may not work reliably at a total core speed below 250MHz.


BUILD-IN CACHE OPTIONS
----------------------
Disabling L1 Cache makes a processor very slow, at least half the processing
speed is cut. Disabling L2 Cache also slows the net speed, but has far less
impact.
SetMul allows disabling the L1 cache on any x86 processor from the 486 onwards.
SetMul allows disabling the L2 cache on the K6 Mobile and VIA C3. Note that
the C3 Samuel 1 has no L2 cache.
Contrary to many other cache disabling tools it still works when EMM386 or
Windows 9X are loaded.


PARAMETERS
----------
/?            - default help screen.
[Multiplier]  - as a single digit like '5', or '5.0', or halves like '5.5'.
L1D           - L1 Cache Disable.
L1E           - L1 Cache Enable.
L1DX          - L1 Cache Disable, exclusively, leaves L2 untouched, for K6-2+/III+.
L1EX          - L1 Cache Enable,  exclusively, leaves L2 untouched, for K6-2+/III+.
L2D           - L2 Cache Disable, but cannot toggle any motherboard L2/L3 cache.
L2E           - L2 Cache Enable,  but cannot toggle any motherboard L2/L3 cache.
ICD           - L1 I-Cache Disable, on VIA C3 or Winchip.
ICE           - L1 I-Cache Enable,  on VIA C3 or Winchip.
BPD           - Branch Prediction Disable, on VIA C3.
BPE           - Branch Prediction Enable,  on VIA C3.
INFO          - Show PowerNow! info of AMD K7 or K8.
CMD           - Disable clock speed measurement. 

Pentium P54C and MMX test register "TR12" options. Parameters:
BPD           - Disable Branch Prediction.
VPD           - Disable V Pipeline.
L1DX          - Disable L1 cache exclusively.
CCD           - Disable L1 code cache.
DCD           - Disable L1 data cache.
PFE           - Pentium Features Enable; Resets the above TR12 options to default.
The status of register TR12 cannnot be read by design.

Multiple commands can be passed at once.

Running SetMul on a K6 mobile / VIA C3 without parameters gives the current
speed. It will also give the multiplier range and parameters that apply.

Also supported are 4 or 5 wide raw bit patterns: like '1010b' or '01010b'. But
these values are not checked for support, and allow for faulty register input!


HARDWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY
-------------------------------------------
- Runs on a 386 or later x86 Processor.
- Compatible with MS-DOS, both with and without EMM386 loaded.
- Compatible with Windows 95, 98 and ME.
- SetMul requires CWSDPMI.exe or a compatible DPMI host.
- SetMul sets up a Ring0 exploit to get privileged access to the CPU registers.
  Windows NT/2K/XP/Vista/7/8/10 or later cannot be fooled this way,
  these operating systems are not supported.
- SetMul or CWSDPMI may conflict with motherboard chipset Throttling or with
  ISA emulation drivers for PCI sound cards.
- Athlon K7 multiplier adjustment requires support from the motherboard
  chipset to work. The earliest K7 chipsets do not offer this support.

- Fixed protection fault when running SetMul on a 486 system
- K6-2+/III+ : Exclusively toggle L1 cache.
- Pentium Pro/2/3 toggle L2 cache.
  (Unfortunately Pentium Pro has been reported not to work with this)
- Winchip C6 toggle I-cache.
- Pentium P54C test register "TR12" options.

v1.2 of 08-07-2015

  Some intended functions do not work, despite following the datasheet by the letter.
  Like Multiplier readout, and Half-speed enable/disable (Parameter HSE and HSD).
  Half-speed may only come to effect in idle mode of the CPU. Regardless,
  these options remain in the program for now.
- Recompiled, seems to have fixed protection fault in v1.2A.
