This directory contains files used to build the ElTorito floppy disk image that gets 
built into the CD .iso. This is what gets loaded if you boot from the CD. 

The disk contains a minimal version of FreeDOS along with a few other utilities. 
Most important is the Patch9X program that can be used to fix CPU bugs with the 9x
kernel that stop it from booting properly on more modern CPUs.
