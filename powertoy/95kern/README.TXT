The Windows 95 Kernel PowerToys
-------------------------------

The Windows 95 kernel team got kind of jealous of all the attention the
shell team has been getting from its PowerToys, so they decided to polish
off their own personal toys and make their own web page.

Mind you, the kernel folks aren't experts at intuitive user interfaces, so
don't expect to see jumping icons and friendly things to click on.  (These
are the people who do their taxes in hexadecimal.)

Conventional Memory Tracking
============================

Not getting enough conventional memory?  This device driver helps you
decipher all the memory that "mem" reports as belonging to "vmm32".
Read CONVMEM.TXT for additional information.

MS-DOS Mode Configuration Wizard Customization Tool
===================================================

Teach the MS-DOS mode wizard how to install your CD-ROM drive, network,
mouse, etc.  Then the next time you need to configure a game for MS-DOS
mode, you can let Windows do the work instead of having to write
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files by hand.  Read DOSWZCFG.TXT for
additional information.

Windows Time Zone Editor
========================

A Windows 95 version of the Windows NT time zone editor.  (So compatible,
it even says "Windows NT" in the title and help file.)  Use this tool if
your country changes its daylight savings time switchover rules.  See
TZEDIT.HLP for additional information.

Windows 95 Keyboard Remap
=========================

Annoyed by the placement of the CapsLock, Ctrl, Shift, and Alt keys on
your keyboard?  Envious of your friends who have the new Microsoft
Natural Keyboard?  This keyboard control panel extension lets you
fight back.  After installing, go to Control Panel, Keyboard, Remap,
and set up your keyboard the way you want it.

To install, right-click the KEYREMAP.INF file and select "Install".
To uninstall, select "Key Remap" from the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel.

Windows 95 Program Monitor ("top")
==================================

Keep an eye on your memory and CPU usage with this monitoring tool.
Read the WINTOP.TXT file for more information.

Windows Logo key control for MS-DOS programs
============================================

This PowerToy lets you configure your MS-DOS game so that Windows will
ignore the Windows logo key while the game is running.  Read the
DOSWINKY.INF file for more information.
