To anyone reading this, sorry about the horribly messy code! The reason for it was I had to change parts of the modules approximately 100 times, and in all those changes your source file(s) generally loses sanity. Also, a lot of this was done in my spare time so I had to put "cosmetic changes" at the lowest priority. And then again, you can always ask me about a bit.

Oh yeah, and remember you need to regsvr32 all the dlls and all the dlls need to be an ANSI build because win9x don't support Unicode fully.
