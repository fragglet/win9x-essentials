# This is a sample LMHOSTS file used by the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for
# Windows for Workgroups 3.11
#
# TO USE THIS FILE, YOU WILL NEED TO RENAME IT TO "LMHOSTS" FROM
# "LMHOSTS.SAM". THE SAMPLE FILE IS INTENTIONALLY NAMED "LMHOSTS.SAM"
# SO THAT IT WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH AN EXISTING "LMHOSTS" FILE.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to computernames
# (NetBIOS) names.  Each entry should be kept on an individual line.
# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the
# corresponding computername. The address and the comptername
# should be separated by at least one space or tab. The "#" character
# is generally used to denote the start of a comment (see the exceptions
# below).
#
# This file is compatible with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x TCP/IP lmhosts
# files and offers the following extensions:
#
#      #PRE
#      #DOM:<domain>
#      #INCLUDE <filename>
#      #BEGIN_INCLUDE
#      #END_INCLUDE
#      \0xnn (non-printing character support)
#
# Following any entry in the file with the characters "#PRE" will cause
# the entry to be preloaded into the name cache. By default, entries are
# not preloaded, but are parsed only after dynamic name resolution fails.
#
# Following an entry with the "#DOM:<domain>" tag will associate the
# entry with the domain specified by <domain>. This affects how the
# browser and logon services behave in TCP/IP environments. To preload
# a #DOM entry, it is necessary to also add a #PRE to the line.
#
# Specifying "#INCLUDE <filename>" will force the RFC NetBIOS (NBT)
# software to seek the specified <filename> and parse it as if it were
# local. <filename> is generally a UNC-based name, allowing a
# centralized lmhosts file to be maintained on a server. If the server
# is located outside of the local broadcast area, it will probably be
# necessary to provide a mapping for the server prior to the #INCLUDE.
#
# The #BEGIN_ and #END_INCLUDE keywords allow multiple #INCLUDE
# statements to be grouped together. Any single successful include
# will cause the group to succeed.
#
# Finally, non-printing characters can be embedded in mappings by
# first surrounding the NetBIOS name in quotations, then using the
# \0xnn notation to specify a hex value for a non-printing character.
#
# The following example illustrates all of these extensions:
#
# 102.54.94.97     rhino              #DOM:networking  #net group's DC
# 102.54.94.102    "appname  \0x14"                    #special app server
# 102.54.94.123    popular            #PRE             #source server
#
# #BEGIN_INCLUDE
# #INCLUDE \\localsrv\public\lmhosts
# #INCLUDE \\rhino\public\lmhosts
# #END_INCLUDE
#
# In the above example, the "appname" server contains a special
# character in its name, the "popular" servername is preloaded, and
# the "rhino" servername is specified so it can be used to later
# #INCLUDE a centrally maintained lmhosts file if the "localsrv"
# system is unavailable.
#
