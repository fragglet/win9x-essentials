SERIAL INFO

Waterfall Pro 2.99 used to be time-limited shareware with cost for registration if you continued to use it.

Since YiHong Software went belly-up, I have done my best (for 2 years) to contact the author of this program to get permission to release the serial numbers he gave me.

I'd done some BETA testing for Tim and had most of his email addys -- none work.  I cannot reach him to ask permission to give out the serials that he gave me for testing all of the Waterfall programs.

So I've taken it upon myself to release this registration serial for Waterfall Pro 2.99.  Tim, if you read this and don't like that I have done this, please contact me and I'll take it off of the web.

So, without further thought to the implications, I give you this info:

When asked for the user and company, add whatever names you want.

**For the registration key, cut and paste this:

2iuKMWx4-aLPMIqh5-xkc7LvEe-txkEmiur


It's possible that if it's already installed that you'll need to add a user and password, so:

username: 2iuKMWx4
password: txkEmiur

Hope it works for you.
