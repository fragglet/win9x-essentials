Waterfall 1.23
By Leading Wintech
------------------

Decrease your CPU temperature up to 30C! Waterfall is a 
wonderful little program that uses advanced instructions 
found in Intel, Cyrix, AMD and IDT CPUs (Pentium or later)
to make them run much cooler, without any loss in performance
or stability! Instead of replacing your fan/heatsink combo, 
give Waterfall a try! You'll wonder how you've ever lived 
without it! 

Waterfall is the most efficient CPU cooler for Windows 95/98!
 
This little utility uses much less resources than CPUIdle, 
and does not require VxDs or DLLs. Because it doesn't need to 
issue hundreds of VxD calls per millisecond, it runs EVEN 
COOLER than CPUIdle! 


What's New in Version 1.23
--------------------------

- Fixed a bug that prevented Waterfall from working with
  early revisions of the Pentium MMX.
- More efficient cooling
- Program runs faster
- Better installation utility
- New uninstall utility

Installation
------------

Simply extract the zip file to a temporary directory and run the
install.exe file.

The installation automatically detects and optimizes your CPU.

WARNING: IF YOU RUN THE WATERFALL.EXE FILE DIRECTLY, WATERFALL WON'T
DETECT YOUR CPU AND MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL. PLEASE USE THE SHORTCUTS 
CREATED BY THE INSTALLATION UTILITY IN YOUR START MENU, OR USE THE 
MANUAL OPTIMIZATION.
