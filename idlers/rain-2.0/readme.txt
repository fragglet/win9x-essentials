Rain 2.0
By Leading Wintech
------------------

Especially designed for overclockers (or for severe heat conditions),
Rain is the latest CPU cooler from Leading Wintech. What makes
it different from other CPU coolers (such as Waterfall and CPUIdle)
is the fact that it has a different concept: "Extreme Cooling!"

With Rain, you'll get the best cooling under Windows 98 nowdays!

Rain was especially designed to give you the biggest temperature 
decrease among all CPU coolers.


Installation
------------

Simply extract the zip file to a temporary directory and run the
install.exe file.

The installation automatically detects and optimizes your CPU.

WARNING: IF YOU RUN THE RAIN.EXE FILE DIRECTLY, RAIN WON'T
DETECT YOUR CPU AND MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL. PLEASE USE THE SHORTCUTS 
CREATED BY THE INSTALLATION UTILITY IN YOUR START MENU, OR USE THE 
MANUAL OPTIMIZATION.
